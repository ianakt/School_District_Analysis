# School_District_Analysis

Purpose of PyCity Schools Analysis:

For the School Board and Superintendent to understand the current state of our schools in our district,
we have created this overview which includes key metrics, regarding performance, budget, school size, school type,
among other factors which given to us by canvas (please see the resources folder)

Please note that the math, and reading scores are
measures of performance of the standardized tests alone.

We disregarded the 9th graders from Thomas High School (THS9), there was a suspicion of some
falsification in their grades, we inlcuded the results before and after they were excluded,
their inlcusion had little effect on the results.

	
  
  Results:
  
  The Average reading, math and overall passing scores and/or percentages are included below for the District, spending per student, and
  top/bottom 5 schools.

Summary:

We'll these results appear to bring more questions than answers. As the spending per student  increased, the passing rate decreased. Another significant finding is that larger schools had significantly lower schools. The most dramatic difference was between district and charter schools, charter schools performed much better. If anything these results indicate that we much to learn from Charter schools, and whether the budget within a certain limits have a positive or negative effect.
